# Real Time Location Tracker App

## Map API Implementation Info

> In order to prevent the Google Map API from being public, this app loads the api key from the local.properties file on Android.


1. Run pub get to generate local.properties
```
flutter pub get
```
Go to android/local.properties <br />
2. Add map key inside the local.properties
```
MAPS_API_KEY=yourAPI
```
